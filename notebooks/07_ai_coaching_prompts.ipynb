      "1. Overview: Your driving trip summary indicates a commendable effort towards fuel efficiency. The average speed of 14.5 km/h and fuel consumption of 0.5 L/100km are impressive, suggesting a smooth, steady pace. However, there are areas for improvement, particularly in reducing idling time and optimizing acceleration and braking. The high RPM at low speeds and the significant number of acceleration and braking events suggest room for refining your driving habits to further enhance fuel efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Coaching suggestions:\n",
      "   - Minimize idling: Try to reduce idling time, as it significantly contributes to fuel waste. If you anticipate a wait, it might be more fuel-efficient to turn off the engine.\n",
      "   - Smooth acceleration: Gradually build up speed instead of rapid acceleration. This not only improves fuel efficiency but also reduces wear on your vehicle.\n",
      "   - Anticipate traffic: Look ahead to anticipate traffic flow and adjust your speed accordingly, reducing the need for frequent braking.\n",
      "   - Maintain consistent speed: Try to maintain a steady speed where possible, as frequent changes in speed can increase fuel consumption.\n",
      "   - Regular vehicle maintenance: Ensure your vehicle is well-maintained. Regular servicing can help optimize engine performance and fuel efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Key takeaway: Your driving is already quite fuel-efficient, but there's potential to further reduce fuel consumption and emissions by minimizing idling, smoothing acceleration and braking, and maintaining a consistent speed.\n",

      "1. Overview: Your driving trip summary indicates an impressive fuel efficiency with an average consumption of 0.4 L/100km. This is largely due to your low average speed of 23.1 km/h and low average RPM of 1038. However, there are areas for improvement, particularly in reducing long idling time (83.35%) and minimizing unnecessary acceleration and braking events (421 and 444 respectively).\n",

      "   - Idle reduction: Try to minimize idling time, especially when waiting at traffic lights or in heavy traffic. If you anticipate a long wait, consider turning off your engine.\n",

Additionally, while your average speed was good, there were a significant number of acceleration and braking events (1289 and 1180 respectively), indicating room for smoother driving.\n",
      "\n",

      "   - Anticipate Traffic: Look ahead to anticipate traffic flow and adjust your speed accordingly to avoid unnecessary braking.\n",
