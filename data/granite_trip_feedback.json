    "feedback": "1. Overview:\nYour recent driving trip was characterized by an unusually low average speed of 14.5 km/h, which is more akin to city driving rather than a typical long-distance journey. The average RPM of 941 indicates that your engine was working harder than necessary, suggesting potential inefficiencies in your driving style. Despite the high fuel consumption rate of 0.5 L/100km, which is relatively low for such a slow speed, there are still areas for improvement, particularly in reducing long idling time (73.67%) and the number of acceleration and braking events (340 and 421 respectively).\n\n2. Coaching Suggestions:\n   - **Reduce Idling**: Try to minimize idling time, especially when waiting at traffic lights or in heavy traffic. Turn off your engine if you're stationary for more than a minute.\n   - **Smooth Acceleration**: Gradually increase speed instead of rapid acceleration. This not only improves fuel efficiency but also reduces wear and tear on your vehicle.\n   - **Maintain a Steady Speed**: Where possible, try to maintain a consistent speed to avoid frequent braking and acceleration. Use cruise control on highways if available.\n   - **Avoid Unnecessary Acceleration**: Anticipate traffic flow and adjust your speed accordingly to avoid unnecessary acceleration.\n   - **Regular Vehicle Maintenance**: Ensure your vehicle is well-maintained. Regular servicing can help optimize engine performance and fuel efficiency.\n\n3. Key Takeaway:\nDespite a relatively low fuel consumption rate, there's significant room for improvement, particularly in managing idling"
